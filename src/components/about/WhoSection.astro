          OmniFert, sprung out of Omni Energy Ltd, which has been a leading
          provider of Engineering and Value Added Oilfield Support Services in
          the Oil and Gas industry for over 10 years. At OmniFert, we transform
          chemicals for a sustainable future. We combine economic success with
          environmental protection and social responsibility. Our locally based
          state-of-the art fertilizer-blending facility is unique in the
          industry and is a result of the premium we place on improving the crop
          production of Africa.

        <p class='mt-2'>
          OmniFertâ€™s approach is not only about providing affordable and quality
          fertilizers to farmers, but focused on providing the right
          specifications of fertilizer according to the soil and crop types. By
          doing this, our company demonstrates its commitment to improving
          agricultural productivity, incomes and employment opportunities in
          Ghana as well as other West African countries.
